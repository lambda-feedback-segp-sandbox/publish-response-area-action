# Publish Response Area Action

This GitHub Action creates a static build of the Sandbox and deploys it to
GitHub Pages. It is intended to be used by instances of the Response Area
Template Repository, but is maintained separately to allow the Lambda Feedback
team to update the deployment process if necessary in the future.
